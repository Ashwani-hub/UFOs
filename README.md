## Overview of the Project
Building an HTML page that will provide in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

Once the website is loaded customer will see basic page with all data.
Customer will have 5 different data filter options to choose from; date, city, state, country & shape. Based on the filter selection, HTML page will show sightings result based on the specific search.


## Summary
Web page is created with clean and easy to read layout that allows users to filter through different criteria that is available in the data set using the search bar created. 
Current filter for the state is limited to state search only and will need to be more adaptive to the nomenclature for other countries as well.
Another item to consider to make the website more dynamic so that new data can be added and available for search as new sightings are reported.
